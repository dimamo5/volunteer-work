            <p>
                Young Peace Brigades (YPB) works in 10 rural and urban communities located across the Central, Northern
                and Ashanti regions of Ghana and also other places in Liberia. The focus of much of our work in
                education is supporting those schools, the teachers, and the principles.

                computer and digital training to youths from underprivileged backgrounds by connecting them to the world
                in a whole new way.
