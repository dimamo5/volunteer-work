        <div class="container text-justify">

                <h1 class="text-center" style="font-weight: 600;">Our Commitment</h1>

            <div class="row" id="whoAreWe">
                <p class="text-justify">People need the opportunity to participate fully in the life of their community if they are to flourish and
                    realise their potential; but certain groups in society are systematically excluded from opportunities
                    that are open to others, because they are discriminated against on the basis of their race, religion,
                    gender, caste, age, disability, or other social identity. </p>

                <p class="text-justify"> People who are excluded like this are not ‘just like’ the rest of the poor, only poorer. They are also disadvantaged
                    by who they are or where they live and as a result are locked out of the benefits of development. Social
                    exclusion deprives people of choices and opportunities to escape from poverty and denies them a voice
                    to claim their rights. Social exclusion is often a cause of poverty, conflict and insecurity. If we are
                    to tackle it effectively, we need to recognize where it is a problem, understand it better, and where
                    appropriate, find different ways of working with partner governments, the international community and
                    civil society organizations to overcome it.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Young Peace Brigades (YPB) is already supporting a variety of activities to tackle exclusion. Good work has been done, particularly
                    across communities in Northern and Central Regions in Ghana. Young Peace Brigades (YPB) is also doing
                    an enormous amount of work to give excluded groups a voice, to ensure their participation in poverty
                    reduction programmes and to build social movements that demand stronger accountability.
