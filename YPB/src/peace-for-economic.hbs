				<h3>Promoting Tourism</h3>
				<p>
					There is a steady stream of tourists to Salaga in the Northern Region who visits the slave markets, slave wells and other
					historic sites to climb the peak, however, the majority of those tourists travel past Salaga to Tamale the regional
					capital that dominate the local tourism industry.<br> We are also providing start-up training to the youth and locals in
					breadbasket weaving, shea-butter production and our hopes is to establish sustainable economic hub for the local economy.

				<h3>Growing the Crafting Industry</h3>
				<p>
					Y.P.B encourages home businesses where families could make quality items available for sale locally.<br> ​We provide continuous
					support to the women that currently make the eco-weave bags and promote and sell those bags.  However we are looking
					to diversify the items made and sold.  If you have a skill set you are willing to share that could be a potential home-based
					business for members of our community please get in touch with us and consider volunteering.

				<h3>Environmental Initiatives and Recycling</h3>
				<p>
					The beauty of our region is breathtaking but upon a closer inspection one will see that many of our landscape are littered
					with trash.  YPB will be working to minimize our use of plastic and implementing composting and recycling programs in
					2017 and plan to have community-wide recycling programs in place by end of 2017.

				<h3>Service Learning Program</h3>
				<p>
					Young Peace Brigades Community Service Learning Program is critical to the local economy as volunteer program fees go directly
					to community members and to small businesses within the rural villages where we live and work.  Our volunteers stay
					with host families where they get their meals, local community members organize our excursions and community members
					provide all of our transportation within Ghana.  Outside of agriculture and Tourist site, YPB is the leading force in
					the local economy as the majority of our annual budget is reinvested in the communities where we work.  Our Ambassadors,
					Service Learning volunteers and Field Service participants support the economy further by spending money in the local
					shops, bars and restaurants.
